## Working with Elasticsearch by Using a Java Client

The goal of this final workshop assignments is to make a simple application which utilizes
Elasticsearch and its features via Java Client.

The test project is based on [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and 
[Spring Data Elasticsearch](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-elasticsearch/).

*For more details about Spring Data project and how to use it with Elasticsearch, check
[Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html/). Note that 
Chapter 1. "Working with Spring Data Repositories"is a general description about Spring Data
project abstraction, while [Chapter 2. "Elasticsearch Repositories"](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html/#reference) 
is a reference documentation for Spring Data Elasticsearch project.*
